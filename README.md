# Project Title: Healthcare Data Analysis and Insights

 ## Problem Statement:
 The healthcare industry generates vast amounts of data daily, providing valuable insights for
 healthcare providers and policymakers to improve patient care, allocate resources effectively,
 and manage healthcare costs. This project aims to analyze a comprehensive healthcare dataset
 comprising medical examinations, hospitalization details, and customer profiles to extract
 insights into patient health profiles, medical histories, and healthcare costs. By exploring
 relationships between various health metrics, identifying trends, and visualizing key patterns, we
 aim to deliver actionable insights to healthcare stakeholders for informed decision-making
 through rigorous data cleaning, transformation, exploration, and analysis.

 ## Project Steps and Objectives:
 ### Data Cleaning:
 1) Check for the number of missing values marked with '?' in each column of the “Medical
 Examinations” Table and "Hospitalization Details" Table.
 2) Fill in the missing values of ‘month’ with Sep and ‘year’ with its average rounded to the
 nearest integer.
 3) Determine the most frequently occurring values in the ‘smoker’, 'Hospital tier' and 'City
 tier' columns, and fill in the missing values accordingly.
 4) If any 'State ID' values are missing, consider filling them with 'Unknown' or using another
 appropriate strategy.

 ### Data Transformation:
 1) Split the ‘names’ column in the “Customer Names” Table into 3 meaningful columns:
 ‘Title’, ‘First Name’, and ‘Last Name’.

 2) Convert the "NumberOfMajorSurgeries" column in the “Medical Examinations” Table to
 numerical data by replacing non-numeric characters with meaningful numerical values.

 3) Check for inconsistencies in the 'Heart Issues' and 'smoker' columns and propose
 corrective actions if necessary.
 
 4) Create a new column named “Weight Status” that categorizes BMI into different
 categories as below:

 **BMI**
 
 Weight Status 
 
 Below 18.5
 
 18.5– 24.9
 
 25.0– 29.9
 
 Underweight
 
 Normal Weight
 
 Overweight
 
 30.0 and Above Obesity
 
 5) Create a new column named “Diabetes Status” and fill it as per the information given below:
 
 **HbA1C**
 
 Diabetes Status
 
 Below 5.7
 
 5.7– 6.4
 
 Normal
 
 Prediabetes
 
 6.5 and Above Diabetes
 
 6) Merge ‘year’, ‘month’ and ‘date’ columns in the “Hospitalization Details” Table into one
 column named ‘Date of Birth’ and format it in ‘DD-MMM-YYYY’ custom format.
 
 7) Calculate the ‘Age’ of each customer based on their ‘Date of Birth’ and the date of
 collection of the dataset, which is 8thJune 2023. (Hint: Use the DATEDIF function)
 
 8) Format ‘charges’ column as currency ($).

### Data Exploration:

**➔CustomerNamesTable:**

 ➢ Arethereanyduplicate Customer IDs in the dataset? If yes, how many?
 
 ➢ Howmanycustomersareincluded in the dataset?
 
 **➔MedicalExamination Table:**
 
 ➢ Howmanycustomershaveahistory of cancer?
 
 ➢ Howmanyobesecustomershaveheart issues?
 
 ➢ Whatisthetotal number of major surgeries performed on customers?
 
 ➢ Calculate the percentage of customers who have undergone any transplants.
 
 ➢ Findtheaverage HBA1C value of customers who are smokers.
 
 **➔Hospitalization details Table:**
 
 ➢ Calculate all the Summary statistics for the ‘charges’ column.
 
 ➢ Findtheaverage hospitalization charges for customers who are more than 50 years old.
 
 ➢ Comparethetotal charges across different hospital tiers.
 
 ➢ Calculate the average charges for people who have more than 2 children.
 
 ➢ Find the integer average number of children of customers who are less than 40 years old.
 
 ### Data Analysis:
 
 ➢ Create a new sheet named “Healthcare", combine all three tables into one, using
 Customer ID as the common column, utilizing VLOOKUP.

 ➢ Retain the following necessary columns: Customer ID, First Name, BMI, HBA1C, Heart
 Issues, Any Transplants, Cancer history, Number Of Major Surgeries, smoker, Weight
 Status, Diabetes Status, Date of Birth, charges, Hospital tier, City tier, State ID, Age.
 Create pivot tables if required to do the following analysis, then visualize through charts:
 
 ### Analysis using Pie/Donut Chart:
 
 ➢ What is the distribution of cancer history among smokers and non-smokers?

 ➢ How does the total number of major surgeries and average HbA1C differ between patients with and without a history of transplants?
 
 ### Analysis using Column/Bar Chart:
 
 ➢ How do healthcare charges vary based on different weight statuses and diabetes statuses?
 
 ➢ Can you compare the average charges for each hospital tier within different states?
 
 ### Analysis using Line/Scatter Plot:
 
 ➢ Isthereany correlation between age and both BMI and HbA1C in the dataset?
 
 ➢ Explore the relationship between age and healthcare charges.
